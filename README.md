# Nutri-Snap
BostonHacks2020 project



This was originally the repository for Nutri-Snap, the first place winner of the 2020 Beyond Code Hackathon.

## Note:

However, due to the nature of hackathons, the development process for this app was done in a hurry, 
and as a result it was not that very well organized, and this repository is now obsolete.
